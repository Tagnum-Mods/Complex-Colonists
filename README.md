# Complex Colonists

Complex Colonists is a minecraft mod made to be used with and requires [MineColonies].
Have you wanted a citizen to brew you some [Botania] potions or craft you a [Extended Crafting]
singularity? Well, hopefully you can in the future when I make it possible.

Right now, this mod is very much WIP and has no usable features currently. Everything is liable
to sudden change. I am both working on this mod to get it working and [MineColonies] api.
